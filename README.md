Lenguajes used: MATLAB
Code developed for: Bachellors final project


 In this project, the process of watermarking handwritten signatures has been investigated.
 Using a database with numerous signers, the necessary force to optimally apply the
 watermark has been analyzed and tested. Additionally, code has been developed for another
 researcher in their work on signature writing using a robotic arm.
